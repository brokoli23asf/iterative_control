The EXIT-WHEN statement lets you complete a loop if further processing is impossible or undesirable. When the EXIT statement is encountered, the condition in the WHEN clause is evaluated. If the condition is true, the loop completes and control passes to the next statement. In the following example, the loop completes when the value of total exceeds 25,000:

LOOP
   ...
   total := total + salary;
   EXIT WHEN total > 25000;  -- exit loop if condition is true
END LOOP;
-- control resumes here
